      <div className="about-story">
        <p>
          Sunshine Coast Grill was founded by Dyllon Houghton, inspired by the laid-back lifestyle and bold flavors of Florida’s coast. 
          The goal was simple, create a place where people could enjoy fresh seafood and feel like they’re on a beach vacation, even if they’re just grabbing a quick meal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, Sunshine Coast Grill grew into a local favorite known for its grilled mahi, crispy shrimp, and flavorful tacos. 
          Like any new business, there were challenges, but the focus on quality food and a great atmosphere helped it stand out. 
          Today, it’s known for bringing real coastal flavor and good vibes to every customer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mission is to serve great food in a fun, relaxed environment where everyone feels welcome. 
          Whether you’re coming in with family or friends, Sunshine Coast Grill is all about good energy, good food, and making people want to come back again.
